# kra_sdk

**!!!DISCLAIMER !!! WORK IN PROGRESS**

A C++ library for loading and saving Krita KRA files.

This is an unfinished product and is still under heavy development. Functionalities will be 
updated alongside the **Godot KRA/PSD Importer** plugin, as found [here](https://github.com/2shady4u/godot-kra-psd-importer/blob/master/README.md), which uses the exact same source code
for importing KRA files into Godot.

Library structure and conventions are based on the [PSD C++ library](https://github.com/MolecularMatters/psd_sdk) as to increase compatability.

Build instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/2shady4u/godot-kra-psd-importer/blob/master/docs/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
